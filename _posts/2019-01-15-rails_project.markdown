For my rails project, I built a wine rating app to help me remember which wines I like, and which I don’t. 

The app allows a user to sign up using an email and password, or log in via GitHub. You can create a bottle of wine, rate any existing bottle of wine, edit any bottles you’ve created, and edit any of your existing reviews. The app doesn’t allow a user to add more than one review per bottle, and I added an option to sort bottles by popularity on the wine index view
