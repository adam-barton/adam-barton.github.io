I've just finished my first project for Flatiron School; the CLI Data Gem project. I was nervous that this project would break me. That I would stare at a blank text editor for months and not know what to do with it. Thankfully, that wasn't the case.  Once I had a project idea that was approved by the school(the second hardest part about this project), I was able to start putting my project together much quicker than I ever thought would've been possible. Don't get me wrong; the project was difficult and I learned a lot, but the most difficult part was something I was not expecting. 

I knew the school recommended using their browser-based IDE for this project, and I planned on following that recommendation, but for me, it was easier to get a start on a local text editor. I figured I'd get some code written out in a local editor before I created a repo and pushed the code up to continue in the browser.  

But the more code I wrote, the more I hesitated to push it into my repo. I kept telling myself that it was because I didn't want to move from my local editor to the browser IDE, but before long I really needed to start testing my code, and my plain text editor wasn't going to cut it any longer. I didn't have any choice but to push the code to my repo. It was then that I realized I had a fear of commitment... or of commit messages. 

Suddenly I would have to start keeping track of all of the changes I made and figure out how to describe what I was intending to do with those changes and condense them into a meaningful commit message. 

It wasn't that I was ashamed of my code. I realize that I'm a beginner and I won't always have the right answer on the first try. But I was nervous that I was going to have to start explaining what I was doing with each save, even when my code didn't accomplish what it was meant to do. 

It's difficult to go from `cmd + s` after every line of code, to need to explain what I was doing. And the idea that anyone can go in and read my commit message, and see the code that I used to accomplish (or that I thought would accomplish) any task. On the one hand, it could show what I've learned and how I've improved. On the other hand, it could make it look like I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. 

Ultimately, for this project, I think I failed at writing meaningful commit messages. Most of my commit messages were similar to "updating *** class" or "fixing bugs." For my next project, I'll make commit messages more of a focus.
