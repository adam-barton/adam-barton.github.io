Hi, I'm Adam.

I've decided to get into web development, so I've enrolled in Flatiron School's Full Stack Web Development course. 

I've always wanted to learn how to code; It's been a lifetime goal. This past year I turned 30 and decided that I couldn't make any more excuses. I have a job that supports my decision, I have the support I need at home to be able to pursue a new skill, and I have the drive. So it's now or never. No more dabbling or just dipping my toes, I need to jump in - Belly first. 

But beyond it being a lifelong goal, I also decided to get into coding because It's an area where talent and skill are visible, and there isn't a lot of room for fakers. That sounds cynical, but anyone who has ever had any job knows at least a few people who have faked their way into a position they weren't suited for. In coding, if you don't have the skills necessary to advance, it seems like it'll be harder to fake your way. 

I also appreciate that Coding is an objective task. Either your code works, or it doesn't. In my career, I've been in some consulting type roles where you can position any report or recommendation to back up your argument. But with coding, it either works, or it doesn't. There isn't much of a gray area where you can fudge the code to pretend that you've completed a task. 

So, here I go. Please feel free to send me any of your helpful tips for getting into a developer mindset, learning techniques, pitfalls to avoid, or anything that a student learning to code might find helpful.
